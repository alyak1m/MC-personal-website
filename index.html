      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p class="box">
        17 year old from Delaware USA. In my free time I like to play games,
        scroll, or nap. I found my liking for coding at a young age by doing
        code.org on my dad's computer. Unfortanately the computer began to stop
        working and I haven't touched any coding until my freshman year of
        highschool and that part to not remembering what the website was called.
        9th grade is when I took intro to computer program, then AP CSP in 10th
        grade, and AP CSA in 11th grade.
