        In this project, I created a simple comment forum that lets users view
        and add comments and includes the date and time of when that comment was
        added along with the display. The program uses Python to read and write
        comment data from a text file. I chose to use a file to save the
        comments so the data wouldn't be lost when the program stops running.

        In this project, I created a program that takes data from the "Top 50
        USA" music ranking chart. The code separates the songs into two separate
        list called "top25Art", which takes the top 25 songs in the ranking, and
        "bottom25Art" which takes the bottom half. It uses the lists to store
        the data of artist, track, and the ranking is used to properly sort them
        according to their ranking. When designing this project, I put each set
        of data in its own separate list. For example, the name of each artist
        was giving to the variable called "artist" using getColumn() and then
        the top 25 are in an empty list called "top25Art" as well as the other
        half in "bottom25Art". Then I used a loop and conditional logic to check
        each songâ€™s ranking and place it in either the top 25 or bottom 25 list
        included with the song and artist at the same index as the ranking.

        In this project, I used arrays to store data from files and created
        methods to search for matching results. This demonstrates that can
        design computer-based solutions to search through data that can be
        specified. I used different arrays for each file information by using
        the FileReader.toStringArray() method such as the artist names were in
        an array called "artistData". Then making the search methods findGenre()
        & findArtist(), I used for loops to go through the data of either genre
        or artist depending on the method and conditional statements to match
        the user input while ignoring capitalization using .equalsIgnoreCase()
        to make the search user-friendly. I also created counters to still give
        an output if what the user searched is not in the list track.
